GCC 13 provides more headers, such as <optional>, <span>, <array>, and <bitset>, for freestanding, although 
these headers may not be portable or provide the same capabilities as a hosted implementation. 

It is better to avoid using them in a freestanding environment, even if the toolchain provides them.
